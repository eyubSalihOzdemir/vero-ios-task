## Hello there!

Let me give you some insight about the project before talking about the requirements and presenting the visual assets:
- First of all, all of the requirements are met and the app is fully functional.
- I tried to be as detailed and honest as possible on commit descriptions. If you wish, you can view the commit history for the development process.
- I also cared about the UX and added small functionalities like debounced searching, alerting before deletion etc. But I didn't add accessibility features since it wasn't required in this task but it would be nice to implement this on a real project of course.
- I could show the any possible errors to the user with simple toast views but I didn't spend any time on that since I believe that is not the main concern in this project and the development phase is the thing that matters.
- I only used one screen view (ContentView) since that's all I needed. I tried to keep everything as simple as possible and I didn't implement any custom animations, a splash screen, custom dynamic themes etc.
- I've used MVVM structure. You can find the data fetching functions in `ContentViewViewModel.swift`.
- I've used a sidemenu Drawer view for the menu screen.
- You can also sort the resources by `Title`, `Task` and `Description`. You can change the sort type in the drawer view.

## Requirement details:
- Request the resources located at `https://api.baubuddy.de/dev/index.php/v1/tasks/select`
  - I can successfully fetch the resources from this endpoint in the background and I publish the results in the main thread.
- Store them in an appropriate data structure that allows using the application offline.
  - I basically had 3 choices for this: *UserDefaults*, *files* or *Core Data*. I choose **Core Data**.
    - User Defaults are not ideal for large sizes of data but itâ€™s practical for saving preferences or other types of â€˜smallâ€™ data.
    - Files might be useful but it also might be hard to manage structural data like our JSON data.
    - Core Data is the ideal solution for structural data since we already have a model in hand to parse JSON. It would also be easier to add relations if we need to fetch another type of data in the future thatâ€™s related to â€˜tasksâ€™. It's also easier to save and load the data for offline use.
- Display all items in a list showing `task`, `title`, `description` and `colorCode` (which should be a view colored according to `colorCode`)
  - I created a very simple list view with LazyVStack (to prevent potential UI performance issues if we fetch large sums of data) to show the desired properties. Hex color code is used as a leading icon in the card views.
- The app should offer a search bar that allows searching for any of the class properties (even those, that are not visible to the user directly)
  - I accomplished this by filtering the CoreData fetched result with NSPredicates on all properties of the Task entity. You can successfully search for all of the properties.
- The app should offer a menu item that allows scanning for QR-Codes. Upon successful scan, the search query should be set to the scanned text
  - I used a custom package (by Paul Hudson, more detail is given in the References headline) for scanning the QR codes since I unfortunately don't have an iPhone to test the codes by myself. The package can simulate a response from the scanner, this way I successfully managed to set the search query to the scan result (you can change the simulated result in `DrawerView.swift`). I also added the camera usage request to Target Properties so I believe you should be able test this feature if you have a physical device. 
- In order to refresh the data, the app should offer a pull-2-refresh functionality
  - The native List view supports a `.refreshable()` modifier but since I wanted a card list instead of the native List style, I again used a package that adds the refreshable feature to the native ScrollView (check out the References headline). There is a bug that I'm aware of with this function: refreshing tasks happens on the main thread (therefore blocking the UI) and upon an error from the HTTP requests during the refreshing animation, it can break the UI (`Refresh` toolbar button on the top left works fine even under these conditions). I tried a few things but I don't want to spend too many time on it since I want to return this task as soon as possible, I hope you can be understanding about this. I still wanted to let you know that I'm aware of this bug.

Hello dear iOS dev prospect!

This repository is supposed to act as a playground for your submission.
Before getting started, please make sure to use this repository as a template on which you will commit and push your code regularly. Once you are ready, please mail us back the link to your repository. 

Below, you will find the **Task** definition. Happy Hacking :computer: and Good Luck :shamrock:

# Task

Write a iOS application that connects to a remote API, downloads a certain set of resources, shows them in a list and provides some basic searching/filtering feature-set.
In particular, the app should:

- Request the resources located at `https://api.baubuddy.de/dev/index.php/v1/tasks/select` 
- Store them in an appropriate data structure that allows using the application offline
- Display all items in a list showing `task`, `title`, `description` and `colorCode` (which should be a view colored according to `colorCode`)
- The app should offer a search bar that allows searching for any of the class properties (even those, that are not visible to the user directly)
- The app should offer a menu item that allows scanning for QR-Codes
  - Upon successful scan, the search query should be set to the scanned text
- In order to refresh the data, the app should offer a pull-2-refresh functionality
  

### Authorization

It's mandatory for your requests towers the API to be authorized. You can find the required request below:

This is how it looks in `curl`:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.baubuddy.de/index.php/login \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic QVBJX0V4cGxvcmVyOjEyMzQ1NmlzQUxhbWVQYXNz' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
        "username":"365",
        "password":"1"
}'
```

The response will contain a json object, having the access token in `json["oauth"]["access_token"]`. For all subsequent calls this has to be added to the request headers as `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}`.

A possible implementation in `Swift` could be the following. You don't have to copy over this one, feel free to indivualize it or use a different network library.

```swift
import Foundation

let headers = [
  "Authorization": "Basic QVBJX0V4cGxvcmVyOjEyMzQ1NmlzQUxhbWVQYXNz",
  "Content-Type": "application/json"
]
let parameters = [
  "username": "365",
  "password": "1"
] as [String : Any]

let postData = JSONSerialization.data(withJSONObject: parameters, options: [])

let request = NSMutableURLRequest(url: NSURL(string: "https://api.baubuddy.de/index.php/login")! as URL,
                                        cachePolicy: .useProtocolCachePolicy,
                                    timeoutInterval: 10.0)
request.httpMethod = "POST"
request.allHTTPHeaderFields = headers
request.httpBody = postData as Data

let session = URLSession.shared
let dataTask = session.dataTask(with: request as URLRequest, completionHandler: { (data, response, error) -> Void in
  if (error != nil) {
    print(error)
  } else {
    let httpResponse = response as? HTTPURLResponse
    print(httpResponse)
  }
})

dataTask.resume()
```
